# Fit Check
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## A problem:
Have you ever went online shopping and went hmmm, would I actually like this product? Have you ever felt indecisive about something and then wish that you bought it? 

Fit Check aims to solve that problem by giving users tailored feedback on products based on their personality and their reviews!

## How it works
Fit Check is a Chrome extension that helps users make better purchasing decisions. Users first take a survey to establish their preferences. The extension then tracks their purchases and periodically asks for reviews, refining recommendations over time. Users can also mark like a weekly budget or weekly allowence into the extension so that it can be tracked easier and better! We could possibly even add an expost weekly purchases to CSV feature so that users can track spending habits online easier!

The extension analyzes shopping habits and reviews using a lightweight ML model, potentially built with TensorFlow.js or Scikit-learn for in-browser predictions. The backend could be written in Go for performance and scalability, handling data processing and API requests efficiently. It may use Firebase or Supabase for authentication and Firestore or PostgreSQL for data storage. The front end could be built with React and Material UI for a sleek user experience.

## How will **WE** make money?

We can use Fit Check to offer tailored product suggestions, generating revenue through referral commissions from recommended products. Companies love to throw money at companies who refer their product, I mean look at the whole Honey-Paypal mess unfolding right now.
